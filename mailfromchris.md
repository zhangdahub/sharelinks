Dear Da,

Thank you for your email and your interest. I'm happy to put you down on the list, but you should know that this is not a lecture. The idea is to watch a film about the Tiananmen events, and then have a discussion about it over some food, and see where the conversation goes--to contemporary China, or the Occupy movement in America, or wherever. There may be quite varied levels of knowledge; I expect some people will be there who know nothing about China all but are interested in the Occupy movement here.

Let me know if your still interested,

CRL
