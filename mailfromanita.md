Greetings.    Regarding your questions at today’s Refworks session:
 
1.   I think Remlee has already mentioned to you that RefWorks does work with Linux
2.   Saving an abstract from Proquest:     
I just did this successfully.   I looked at a full record in Proquest to be sure it had an abstract.   
I exported the record to RefWorks.  In “full view” in Refworks, the abstract appears.   Try it again.    
Note:   In Refworks you can view citations in Full View, Standard View, or “One line/Cite” view.    
You want to be in Full View to see the abstract.    
To select Full view, see  “Change View” on the References tab and select Full View from the menu:
3.   I don’t yet have an answer for why the journal “Energy” would not transfer to your output style quick list on that computer.   It worked fine on the instructor’s computer in our classroom; it works on my own laptop; and it worked on another student’s Mac laptop.   So this will take some investigation.   Try it on your own computer and let me know if it works.
